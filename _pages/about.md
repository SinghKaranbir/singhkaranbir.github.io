I am a Senior Software Engineer at Salesforce, where I focus on backend technologies, AI, and time series analysis. With over seven years of experience in AI/ML engineering, distributed systems, and software development, I’ve had the privilege of leading high-performing teams and delivering impactful solutions across fintech, automotive, and other industries.

Throughout my career, I’ve been passionate about driving innovation and creating systems that solve real-world problems. At TrueML, I managed a critical engineering team to deploy machine learning models in production, improving feature development velocity and client engagement. My time at Lucid Motors and Poynt allowed me to contribute to cutting-edge product capabilities, strengthen industry partnerships, and develop systems that enhanced both user experience and business outcomes.

I am proud to be an IEEE Senior Member and the author of upcoming book Mastering Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Comprehensive Guide to LangChain, LlamaIndex, and LLMs. My work in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems has given me the opportunity to speak at events like AI GDG San Jose and GDG Silicon Valley, where I’ve shared insights on responsible AI and crafting trustworthy RAG systems.

Academically, I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Software Engineering from San Jose State University. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to be recognized for my contributions, including winning the Silicon Valley Innovation Challenge. I also enjoy mentoring emerging talent, reviewing technical books and IEEE eLearning courses, and fostering collaboration across teams.

Currently, I’m working on exciting projects, including developing agents to reduce on-call burdens and ensuring fair and balanced information retrieval in RAG systems. I’m also contributing to agriculture automation research, exploring the use of Vision Transformers and CNNs for plant disease detection.
